# TicTacToe
Our TicTacToe game

This is the our repository for our Tic Tac Toe game, everyone needs to at least attempt the programming and understand all of 
our code as everyone will be marked on it.

You need to install GIT which is on moodle here 
https://cumoodle.coventry.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1023843/mod_resource/content/1/IntroductionToGitHub.pdf

Once you have installed GIT read the instructions on how to Pull and Push files as this is how we need to make our game
